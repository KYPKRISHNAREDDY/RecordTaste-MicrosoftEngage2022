Record Once. Machine Makes Forever . Just Eat And Chill.

-Theme of Project
-


This web app has been developed by Krishna Reddy under the Microsoft engage program 2022 (May 4 - May 29)



As  We are in the era of Automation , we can see everything is getting automated from Face Recognition to  Self Driving Cars..

Imagine How cool it would be “If cooking also Gets Automated”

Even though this is not possbile as of Now , There are high Chances to be available in  future.



Lets say There is “ A Machine(Hypothetical as of Now) will be there and it will have RecordDish , CookDish options and some containers to dump the  ingredients to cook.

Suppose we  Started cooking.
we will press the RecordDish Option on the machine.

Machine will observe every minute things like
 “How many grams of salt,Pepper etc.. is added” , 
” Whats the time Gap between adding salt and Vegetable Pieces”,
“How much Pressure is applied while stirring the spoon”
” How much Centigrade Flame is maintained”
“How many grams of Vegetables are added” etc........

it will record the Cooking Process of That Particular Dish and now it will be having the code on How to Cook that dish

From Next Time,we just have to Load that Dish Program to the  Machine and press the CookDish Option and dump the required ingredients into containers of that machine 
it will Cook For Us by seeing the RecordedCode.
Meanwhile we can do whatever work we had and chill when the machine is cooking for us 


-Role of this WebApp RecordTaste
-
RecordTaste WebApp Provides the interface to get codes(Recordings) for Cooking the Dishes.

Many Users/Chefs will sell their Recordings on our website and User who purchased that code will load that code into  machine and 
Machine will cook that Dish with ChefTaste Meanwhile user can do whatever work he had.

With this,being in Foreign we can Eat homeFood which is being cooked by our parents in India


This WebApp has great Potential.
Ex: Just like Youtube,Normal Users also can record their cooking and can upload the code on Website which will be available to the whole world  (this feature is not included in website as of Now)
Our  website will recommend Dishes based on UserProfile 
As user Browses for Dishes,Our WebApp will Recommend similar dishes based on item User visited 
He can add some Dishes to Cart 
He can Purchase Dishes and our WebApp will recommend similar Dishes based on Purchase History
