## About
-Theme of Project


RecordTaste is a web app inspired by Automation which is full fledged recommendation ECommerce website with Add to Cart along with features of feed containing recommendations based on Dish you clicked on,with Profile based recommendations,with Order History based Recommendations .This webapp has been developed by Krishna Reddy under the Microsoft engage program 2022 (May 4 - May 29)

## Idea
Idea Behind The Project:
As  We are in the era of Automation , we can see everything is getting automated from Face Recognition to  Self Driving Cars..

Imagine How cool it would be ‚ÄúIf cooking also Gets Automated‚Äù
Even though this is not possbile as of Now , There are high Chances to be available in  future.

Lets say There is ‚Äú A Machine(which is hypothetical as of Now) , it will have Options:RecordDish , CookDish and Some Storage Containers to dump the  ingredients to cook.

Suppose we  Started cooking Biryani.
we will press the RecordDish Option on the Machine and start Our Cooking.

Machine will observe every minute things when we are Cooking like
 ‚ÄúHow many grams of salt,Pepper etc.. is added‚Äù , 
‚Äù Whats the time Gap between adding salt and Vegetable Pieces‚Äù,
‚ÄúHow much Pressure is applied while stirring the spoon‚Äù
‚Äù How much Centigrade Flame is maintained‚Äù
‚ÄúHow many grams of Vegetables are added‚Äù etc........

it will record the Cooking Process of That Particular Dish and 
now it will be having the Program on How to Cook that dish

From Next Time,We dont need to cook the Dish,
we just have to Load that Dish Program to the  Machine and press the CookDish Option and 
dump the required ingredients into containers of that machine 

it will Cook For Us by seeing the RecordedCode.
Meanwhile we can do whatever work we had and chill when the machine is cooking for us 


## Role Of This WebApp

-
How amazing it would be " If a Person can share their FoodTaste with another Person who is at Another corner of The World."
RecordTaste WebApp provides that Features
This Provides the interface to get Programs(Recordings) for Cooking the Dishes.
Many Users/Chefs will sell their Recordings on our website and User  will load that code into His machine and 
Machine will cook that Dish with ChefTaste Meanwhile User can do whatever work he had.

With this,being in Foreign we can Eat homeMadeFood which is being cooked by our parents in India

## Features of this WebApp

This WebApp has Potential to Become as Best User Engaged Platforms similar to Youtube,Flipkart,Amazon .
Ex: Just like Youtube,Normal Users also can record their cooking and can upload the code on Website which will be available to the whole world  (this feature is not included in website as of Now)

Our  website will recommend Dishes based on ** UserProfile **

As user Browses the feed,Our WebApp will Recommend similar dishes based on items User visited 
User can add some Dishes to Cart 
User can Purchase Dishes and our WebApp will recommend similar Dishes based on Purchase History

## Agile
I have adopted the **Scrum** methodology for the development of the product. I divided the 25Days of the program into four sprints , each consisting of Six Days.
Before every sprint I used to set a target for that week/sprint and then work on that.

**Sprint 1** : The first sprint started from 4th May ,I have dedicated SPRINT 1 Completely to Choose the Project out of 3Projects given by Microsoft Engage team.
As there are multiple factors to Consider while choosing the Project as Beginner in TechStack Field.
After Considerin Muliple factors,I decided to go with 3rd Project:Recommendation Algorithm WebApp
I went through basics needed to build what I a intended to apply in my Project.I started planning about how to develop and design my website. I made a basic prototype of what features I was going to include and how. Later I added the mandatory feature to my website.

After Sprint 1 was over I took feedback from my friends,Seniors and family about what actually they would have wanted from an webapp. I noted them and then worked upon them accordingly.

**Sprint 2 and 3** : Now that I had mandatory feature already built and also got my mentor assigned to me , in Sprint 2 and 3 , I worked upon adding additional features to my website. During this phase/sprint I used to continuously take inputs from my Seniors, friends and then modify my product as per the needs.
I made Manual DataSet for My DataBases which is the Key Thing in this Project.



**Sprint 4** : This was the last sprint I had in the development phase. I was close to the delivery date so I basically took feedbacks from Friends and other people around me on the UI of my product and then improved the UI of my app to a great extent. This added beauty to my product and made it delivery ready as well.
